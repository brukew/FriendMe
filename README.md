## Overview
### Description

FriendMe is a friend finder app that utilizes the API's of various user platforms to connect them to others with similar interests. Users will be able to connect their various accounts such as Twitter, Youtube, Spotify, and Steam, and apply weights to scale their significance in friend matching.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Media / Friend Finding
- **Mobile:** People would go to this app in empty pockets of their day. Lots of work to pull your computer out just for this. Easier to chat with people and better for UI. Could incorporate location.
- **Story:** App will provide users with a simple way to connect to people with similar interests. Gives them an opportunity to talk about their favorite shows, music and games. High value.
- **Market:** Large market. Attractive to kids 18 and under that want to meet others but do not have the ability to do so. Adults may not be as attracted but still caters to them.
- **Habit:** Users may not spend too much time on this app, but will go to it in empty spaces of the day. People may leave app to other messaging platforms after matching with someone.
- **Scope:** This app can be completed in 5 weeks and a stripped down version of it would not be bad. The only important thing are the integrations of the API's which may cause trouble since I want to do a couple platforms.
